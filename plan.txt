============================== DAY 1 ====================================

AngularJS basics 
	+ MVC concept, MVVM concept, decoupling data, logic and DOM
	+ 2-way data binding concept 
	+ Declarative programming concept
	+ Framework history
	+ AngularJS pros and cons

Module concept
	+ Modules definition
	+ Modules retrieving
	+ Dependency injection
		+ ad-hoc serving
		+ modularity
	+ Main module and Angular application bootstrapping
	- injecting custom module
	
Directive concept basics
	+ Extending basic HTML with custom elements, attributes and interactions
	+ Declarative way of expression

Scope concept
	+ Coupling logic and view
	+ Model incapsulation
	+ API for model changes watching
	- API listening / broadcasting events
	+ Nesting scopes
	+ Scopes inheritanse and method / property lookup
	+ Digest loops and dirty checking

Controller concept
	+ Class pattern
	+ Coupling controller to DOM
	+ Exposing controller props and methods to view using "as" notation.
	+ Exposing controller props and methods to view using scope.
	- Nesting controllers and scopes, calling parent scope methods

Templating
	- ng-bind
	+ Expressions and built in variables
	+ Built-in directives: (ng-repeat, ng-model, ng-show/ng-hide, ng-if, ng-<event>)
	- ng-form, ng-href, ng-src as a workarounds for potential issues
	- ng-include
	+ Forgiving object definition

Filter concept
	+ Changing presentation, leaving model intact
	+ Built-in filters (json, lowercase/uppercase, number, filter)
	+ Passing params to filters
	+ Chaining filters
	+ Filters pros and cons (performance impact)
	- "Filtered as" syntax



============================== DAY 2 ====================================

Service concept
	- Singltone pattern
	- Factory pattern
	- Provider
	- Built-in services ($window, $timeout, $interval, $http)
	- $http service and promise concept
	- Custom properties of $http promise
	- $resource service
	- $q service, deferred objects and custom promises

Routing concept
	- Config section: $routeProvider
	- External templates
	- Page controllers
	- Route params
	- Route events ($routeChangeStart, $routeChangeSuccess, $routeChangeError, $routeUpdate)
	- $location service: .url(), .protocol(), .host(), .path(), .search()
	- two-way binding between query string and controller data
	- run section (login case)

Directives in-depth
	- Directive definition object
	- Templates (internal, external, dynamically set)
	- Scopes: parent, inherites, isolated. Passing data into isolated scope
	- Controllers, requesting external controllers
	- Compile and Link phases
	- Transclusion: definition in template, transcluded scope
	- Nested directives, compiling and linking order
	- caching external templates (script templates and templateCache)

Components
	- serving custom directive as a component: possible approaches
	- extending directives with shared controller and scope

Performance problem and other issues and ways to work around them
	- Filters multiple evaluation, using filters inside controllers and services
	- Scopes isolation, nesting and inheritance
	- ng-if
	- One-time binding
	- track by
	- $scope.$digest() vs $scope.$apply and events (?)
	- ng-cloak
	- ng-init and other ways to declare vars and methods silently

Unit testing
	- Toolkit: Jasmine, Karma, PhantomJS, browser launchers.
	- describe()
	- it()
	- beforeEach() and afterEach()
	- Matchers
	- Spies
	- ngMocks and built-in mock objects
	- Dependency injection
	- Custom mocks

Unit testing filter

Unit testing service

Unit testing controller

Unit testing directive

Setting up a very basic project (todo app or something similar)
	- Git
	- Github / Bitbucket
	- NodeJS + npm
	- Grunt
	- Bower (Why Bower?)

Automated project deployment in depth
	- npm 
		- configuring npm
		- installation workflow: preinstall, installation, postinstall
	- Bower
		- why use Bower?
		- configuring Bower
	- Grunt
		- configuring Grunt
		- collecting Bower components and assets
		- building SCSS
		- collecting external templates
		- building Angular app 
		- annotating component definitions
		- concatenating and minifying scripts
		- linting / hinting
		- running tests
		- publishing and packaging app
		- dev and pub workflow
